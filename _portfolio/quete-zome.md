## The Quest 

Moving in Chiang Mai, I gravite around a group of friends involved in the art/music/fun festival JaiThep. This year they went from 1 day to 3days with more stages. My friend Joshua wanted to build a Zome for the Chill Out stage. Obviously, I forced him to take me as a partner. 

We had 3 months and 10 days on site to build a stage that will play 24/24h for 3days. A limited budget, and a new country to discover for me.

## The Crew

- Joshua : Co-Heroes; amazing Australian dude, with skills in carpenting, musician and dj skills

- MickaÃ«l : The Wise, telepathic transmission of electronic and arduino skills
- Art Team : lead by Joelle, guru in Tie-Dye
- Chelsea : The Mother of JellyFish
- Camille : SideKick
- The helpers

## The Journey

I joined Joshua on the 27th of November 2017, he already had an idea of the disposition of the area.

The theme of the festival was : An other world.

Our location was near a little river, and surrounding by mountains. So I turned this around the idea of Atlantis, and giant sleeping under ground. The zomes would be their hat.

We will need two eyes, and a lot of fabrics !


We started by doing some math and building a first prototype. We made a lot of rookies mistakes. It was a good thing ! (posts)


Then we could start on the BIG ONE !

During the installation, it wasn't all go as we wanted. We only kept one eye and put it in the center. Not looking like a giant anymore but fun enough :D and less electronics to do in a small amount of time.

At the end it looked very nice ! And the area was a hit, a lot of people were chilling there under the shades and by the river. DJs had a lot of space to move. And the lightning at night fave it an extra really aesthetic look.
