A friend let me stay in his apartment during one of my stays at [OpenFab](http://openfab.be/). He has a good bed, a cat and nice books. So you know, I wanted to thank him. My mom raised me right.

## Process 

I used the [TabbedBox extension](https://github.com/paulh-rnd/TabbedBoxMakerl) to build the vector file on inkscape, inspired by [Nicolas](https://nicolasdb.github.io/post/boxes/). 
After generating the box with the correct parameters (size, kerf, etc), I added a little bit of text, a good meme, a hole for the bag's spout, and a removable bottom. 

I put a 3mm mdf in the lasercut:
- Engrave in orange = for the slide, then I trimmed the wood with a thin cisel. Setting : fill + fast
- Cut = green for the first cut. Black for the final cut. Why ? This way your wood doesn't move during the small cuts.

After that, I flipped the side of one of the panels, and engraved the grumpy cat's meme. (thanks Dewi for your help)

## Potential upgrades

- Make a bigger hole for the bag's spout.
- Add a nice varnish.
- Don't do it last minute.
- Design a better refill system.
